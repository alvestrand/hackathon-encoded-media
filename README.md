# hackathon-encoded-media

This repo contains files for use with the WebRTC project at the hackathon in conjunction with IETF 115. It deals with new ways of handling encoded data (other than [webrtc-encoded-transform](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-encoded-transform/)).

The purpose of the hackathon session is to investigate new shapes of APIs for encoded media by making "demos" that exercise those APIs.

This follows on from the discussions about encoded media APIs at TPAC.

It's likely to be possible to get those demos somewhat functional by shimming "new" APIs on top of the older APIs - not to achieve the full functionality, but to get a "feel" for how it's possible to write the kind of apps that we may want. 

Read the API.md file to get an idea of one possible shape of the API we're trying to play with.
