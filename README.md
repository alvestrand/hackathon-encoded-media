# hackathon-encoded-media

This repo contains files for use with the WebRTC project at the hackathon in conjunction with IETF 115. It deals with new ways of handling encoded data (other than [webrtc-encoded-transform](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-encoded-transform/)).

Read the API.md file to get an idea of the API we're trying to play with.
